Working Website Title: "Love Is Love, Even Under The Rainbow"

Description: To quickly summarize and introduce the main objective of our website, it is very simply a website designed to inform, educate, and correct people on the LGBTQ+ community. As to why we have chosen to make this the goal of our website as well as the specific main topic of our website, it's because we believe it is important for people, especially those outside of the community, to be informed and understanding of the community, and hopefully through a simple introduction to the community through this website, these people may be able to grow their acceptance, love, and knowledge on the community, whether a part of it or not. When it comes to achieving this goal however, we would need to remember some key elements which are integral to achieving the said goal, like how it is important that the website gets across that the different sexualties/gender identities people have are simply these traits people are born with like our own nationalities since this would portray those from the community as humans just like anybody else. It is also important that our explanations and clearing up of information on the various sub-groups of the LGBTQ+ community are descriptive but easy to understand as this would create a great place for anybody who seems confused about this topic, such as those from more conservative countries or those who've simply not interacted with that many people in the LGBTQ+ community, to educate themselves on it and thus create an empathetic understanding of it. All in all, 

Outline of The Website: 

  Webpage 1: The 1st webpage would obviously be the homepage of the website. The main eye-catching feature of the homepage would be the colorful rainbow starting from the bottom of one side of the homepage then making the shape of an arc that reaches the topmost part of the homepage then goes back down and ends at the bottom of the other side of the homepage. Under the rainbow would be a short description of the aim of the website (Educating on the LGBTQ+ community) to those first entering. Under that short description and at the middle and bottom portions of the homepage would be the links to the other webpages, with each link having an image (corresponding to the webpage the link goes to) above the link, as well as a description below the link which gives a brief description and summary of the webpage the link corresponds to.
  
  Webpage 2: The 2nd webpage would be all about the various sexualities which fall under the LGBTQ+ community (i.e. Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuality, Pansexuality, Asexuality, etc.). At the top of the webpage would be a concise description of what sexuality is and some important information surrounding it to prepare the viewer for the rest of the webpage. Below this description of the webpage, each sexuality would have its own portion of the webpage with a description of the sexuality which includes, but will probably not be limited to, information like which kinds of people those with that particular sexuality are attracted to. Above that description but below the header (Sexuality name) would be the image of the flag of that particular sexuality. At the very end and bottom of the webpage, we would have a description of the fight by those non-heterosexual people with different sexualities in order to get the same equal rights and privileges that those heteresexual people do in fact have. We will also have links just below that particular description, one to go back to the main homepage and one to go the next webpage on gender identities. 
  
  Webpage 3:
  
  Webpage 4: The 4th webpage would feature some common misconceptions that people may have about the LGBTQ+ community (i.e. "sexuality is a choice", "bisexuality is just a phase", etc.) and elaborate on what the actual truths are. *insert design description here*
  
  Webpage 5: The 5th page would be about historical figures that were, at least from what we currently know, most likely a part of the LGBTQ+ community (i.e. Fredrick the Great, Achilles, Patroclus, Alan Turing, etc.). *insert design description here*
