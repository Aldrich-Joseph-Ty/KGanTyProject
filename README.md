Working Website Title: Love Is Love, Even Under The Rainbow

Description: 

Outline of The Website: 

  Webpage 1: The 1st webpage would obviously be the homepage of the website. The main eye-catching feature of the homepage would be the colorful rainbow starting from the bottom of one side of the homepage then making the shape of an arc that reaches the topmost part of the homepage then goes back down and ends at the bottom of the other side of the homepage. Under the rainbow would be a short description of the aim of the website (Educating on the LGBTQ+ community) to those first entering. Under that short description and at the middle and bottom portions of the homepage would be the links to the other webpages, with each link having an image (corresponding to the webpage the link goes to) above the link, as well as a description (also corresponding to the webpage the link goes to) below the link.
  
  Webpage 2: The 2nd webpage would be all about the various sexualities which fall under the LGBTQ+ community (i.e. Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuality, Pansexuality, Asexuality, etc.). Each sexuality would have its own portion of the webpage with a description of the sexuality which includes, but will probably not be limited to, information like which kinds of people those with that particular sexuality are attracted to, as well as the history of the people under that sexuality and their fight to be recognized and treated as equal. Above that description but below the header (Sexuality name) would be the image of the flag of that particular sexuality.
