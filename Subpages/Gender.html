  <h1> Human Gender Identity </h1>

  <hr>

  <p id=introduction>

    Hello and welcome to this website's page on Gender Identities! *intro stuff*

  </p>

  <div class=subpages>

    <h2> Sex vs. Gender</h2>
    
    <p> People sometimes use "Sex" and "Gender" interchangeably, but they are actually two very different things. Sex is a biological term based on body parts and such while Gender refers to our internal sense and understanding of ourselves. </p>

    <br>

    <h2> The Gender Spectrum </h2>

    <p> First of all, what is Gender Identity? Well, Gender Identity is our internal concept of our own gender. There are plenty of different gender identities on the gender spectrum, ranging from male to female to everything in between (non-binary). Below is a visual representation of the gender spectrum:</p>

    <img src="/Images/gender spectrum.jpg" height="400px" width="400px">

    <p> In this diagram, there are four main circles: one representing males genders, one representing female genders, one representing agender, and one representing genderfluid. To better understand each gender, let's go over the main categories of gender: Male, Female, and Non-Binary. </p>

    <br>

    <ul>

    <li> <h3> Male </h3>

    <p> Not too sure how one would describe this, but we'll figure it out</p> </li>

    <br>

    <li> <h3> Female </h3>
    
    <p> still dunno how to describe this one </p> </li>

    <br>

    <li> <h3> Non-Binary </h3>

    <p> talk about how this is an umbrella term for the genders that are somewhere between or beyond being male/female. some stuff under non-binary would be agender and genderfluid, the other two circles in the diagram. 
      
      [(use this to help with this non-binary thing) A gender identity and an umbrella term for people whose identity falls outside of the binary of male and female. Some people don't identify fully, or at all, with the gender they were assigned at birth and some people have no gender at all.] </p> </li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <p> maybe talk a little about how the circles in the diagram overlap and stuff, i dunno</p>

    <br> <br>

    <h2> What Does It Mean To Be Transgender? </h2>

    <p> something about identifying as something other than your birth gender </p>

    <h2> Some Terms to Know </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Ally - Someone who is not a part of the LGBTQ+ community who still chooses to support those who are actually a part of the community. </li>
      <li> Cisgender - A person who's gender aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth. </li>
      <li> Gender Expression - How one externally expresses their gender (Like how they dress or how they act, for example). </li>
      <li> Passing - (needs rephrasing because copy pasted) When someone who is gender variant is regarded to be, or 'passes' as a cisgender man or cisgender woman. </li>
      <li> (might need rephrasing since it's sorta similar to the source) Genderqueer - A gender identity label often used as an umbrella term for many gender non-conforming or non-binary identities. </li>
      
    </ul>
