  <h1> Human Gender Identity </h1>

  <hr>

  <p id=introduction>

    Hello and welcome to this website's page on Gender Identities! 
    
    Unlike Sexual Orientation which deals with a person's attraction to other people, Gender Identity deals with someone's own internal feelings on what they are. Simply put, whereas Sexual Orientation deals with the external, Gender Identity deals with the internal.

    We hope this webpage can shed some light on those wih varying and different gender identities from your own, and that hopefully you can gain a basic understanding at the very least of the wide spectrum of gender identities that people can identify as.

    <h2> Sex vs. Gender</h2>
    
    <p> People sometimes use "Sex" and "Gender" interchangeably, but they are actually two very different things. Sex is a biological term based on body parts and other biological factors, while Gender refers to our internal sense and understanding of ourselves. 
    
        Not only that, but, unlike gender which lies on a "gender spectrum", sex is a biological term meaning that it isn't exactly on a spectrum. There are only about 3 sexes actually: Males who have male biological parts, Females who have female biological parts, and those who are considered Intersex meaning they have both male and female biological parts.</p>

    <br>

    <h2> The Gender Spectrum </h2>

    <p> First of all, what is Gender Identity? Well, Gender Identity is our internal concept of our own gender. There are plenty of different gender identities on the gender spectrum, ranging from male to female to everything in between (non-binary). Below is a visual representation of the gender spectrum:</p>

    <img src="/Images/gender spectrum.jpg" height="400px" width="400px">

    <p> In this diagram, there are four main circles: one representing masculine genders, one representing feminine genders, one representing agender, and one representing genderfluid. To better understand each gender, let's go over the main categories of gender: Male, Female, and Non-Binary. </p>

    <br>

    <ul>

    <li> <h3> Male </h3>

    <p> Those who identify as male (whether they are cisgender or transgender) identify their gender identity as being of the sex "male" as well.</p> </li>

    <br>

    <li> <h3> Female </h3>
    
    <p> Those who identify as female (whether they are cisgender or transgender) identify their gender identity as being of the sex "female" as well. </p> </li>

    <br>

    <li> <h3> Non-Binary </h3>

    <p> "Non-binary" is an umbrella term for the genders that are somewhere between or beyond being male/female. Some gender identities under non-binary would be those who identify as agender (Someone who doesn't identify as a particular gender) and genderfluid (Someone whose gender can fluctuate between different different genders over time. An example would be someone who identified as a man before but now identifies as a woman), the other two circles in the diagram. were assigned at birth and some people have no gender at all.] </p> </li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <p> It is also important to note that since gender is on a spectrum, these circles overlap. So someone who may be genderfluid may actually be masculine genderfluid or feminine genderfluid. Simply put, someone's gender identity can be a range of hues and isn't confined to just one particular identity or range of identities.</p>

    <br> <br>

    <h2> What Does It Mean To Be Transgender? </h2>

    <p> To put it simply, someone who identifies as transgender is a person who identifies as a gender different from their assigned sex/gender. The two main groups of transgenders are those who are Transfem (Generally those assigned male at birth, but have realized that they more closely identify as female) and those who are Transmasc (Generally those assigned female at birth, but have realized they more closely identify as male). </p>
