    <h2> Sexualities </h2>

    <img src="/Images/gay.png" alt="Sexualities" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Someone who is gay is someone who identifies as a man and is only sexually and romantically attracted to other men. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Lesbian </h3>

    <img src="/Images/lesbian.png" alt="Gender" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> A lesbian is specifically someone who identifies as a woman and is only sexually and romantically attracted to other women. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Omnisexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/omnisexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> (definitely not finished. also i got this from quora) Someone who identifies as omnisexual is attracted to all genders. However, this is not as a gender blind attraction, so someone who is omnisexual may have preferences. </p>

    <br> 

    <h3> Pansexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/pansexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> *insert desc* </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Polysexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/polysexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Someone who identifies as polysexual is someone who is attracted to many (though not necessarily all) genders. For example, someone who is polysexual may be attracted to all genders except cisgender women. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Asexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/asexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> (wip) Someone who identifies as Asexual (or ace, for short) feels little to no sexual attraction, but may or may not still experience romantic attraction. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Demisexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/demisexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Demisexuality technically falls under the umbrella of asexuality. However, unlike a person who identifies as asexual, a person who identifies as demisexual may experience sexual attraction, but only toward people they have a strong emotional connection with. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Aromantic </h3>

    <img src="/Images/aromantic.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Someone who identifies as Aromantic experiences little to no romantic attraction, but may still experience sexual attraction. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Demiromantic </h3>

    <img src="/Images/demiromantic.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Demiromantic falls under the umbrella of aromatic. However, unlike someone who identifies as aromantic, someone who identifies as demiromantic may experience romantic attraction, but only toward people they have a strong emotional connection with. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> AroAce </h3>

    <img src="/Images/aroace.jpg" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Someone who identifies as AroAce experiences neither romantic nor sexual attraction. </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Abrosexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/abrosexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> Someone who identifies as abrosexual is someone whose preferences may change overtime. 

      (figure out how to paraphrase:
      whose sexuality and preferences may change throughout their lives. Different levels of sexual (and romantic) feelings through time are very common—and sometimes people identify their sexuality as "fluid"—but the distinction for an abrosexual person is that these periods of change can happen quickly and with different intensities. It can also look like changing one's actual sexual orientation.) </p>

    <br>

    <h3> Pomosexual </h3>

    <img src="/Images/pomosexual.png" height="240px" width="400px">

    <p> (wip) Pomosexuality can be both an umbrella term and a sexuality. Someone who is pomosexual may feel attraction, but would prefer not to elaborate more on or put a label on it.   </p>
